# Home assignments
The tasks assigned on a weekly basis are stored in the "labs" file under a specific week number. There are 2 concepts of these assignments - first files trying to replicate algorithms behind discussed models and functions manually to understand the "black box" inside and, second, competitions to build the best model possible according to defined metrics on a given data set. All files are written in Python language utilizing Keras, Pytorch, numpy, and basic Python libraries. The assignments have been solved concerning the course requirements, however, they are kept separately in the private repository as requested.
